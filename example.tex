\section{\faLaptop}{Covid-19 County Case Tracker}
From March 2020-January 2021 I developed and maintained the \href{https://covid19cct.shinyapps.io/covid19cct/}{\textit{Covid-19 County Case Tracker}} R Shinyapp. I used R programming to harvest publicly available national Covid-19 data and provide visualisations of the trends in Covid-19 cases at the county-level in England and Scotland. During the first UK lockdown the app received over 100+ hours of usage per day, garnering attention from radio and media outlets including the \href{https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/18358052.app-tracks-oxfordshire-covid-19-cases/}{Oxford Mail}.
